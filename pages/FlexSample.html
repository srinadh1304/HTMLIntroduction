                    <p>A taco is a traditional Mexican dish consisting of a small hand-sized corn or wheat tortilla topped with a filling. The tortilla is 
                       then folded around the filling and eaten by hand. A taco can be made with a variety of fillings, including beef, pork, chicken, seafood, 
                       beans, vegetables, and cheese, allowing for great versatility and variety. They are often garnished with various condiments, such as
